# CMPT 315 Assignment 1

This is an information webpage I created on the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. There is an overview and history on Bitcoin, as well as the price and recent news. This was for an assignment in my web application development class at MacEwan University and was my first attempt at creating a webpage with CSS and HTML.

The page is deployed at the following link:
